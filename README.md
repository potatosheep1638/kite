# Kite
A simple Redlib front-end for Android.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Kite is still in BETA, so expect bugs. If you encounter any, feel free to open an issue in this repository.

**What is Kite?** A simple application that allows you to browse [Redlib](https://github.com/redlib-org/redlib) from an app instead of a browser. There is still a bunch of work to be done, but the app is in a usable state. I made it mostly for personal use, but you may find some use for it too.

**Why the name 'Kite'?** Because I am devoid of creativity.

## Features
- View posts, subreddits and users
- Search for posts and subreddits
- Subscribe to subreddits (locally saved)
- Save posts (locally saved)
- Easily switch between instances: your saved posts will be automatically migrated to the newly selected instance
- Export/import saved posts

> [!TIP]
> Remember to allow Kite to open reddit links in the **Open by default** settings page.

There are a number of features that are still missing (e.g., user flairs). Unfortunately, these features will take some time to implement, even if they are simple ones. See [Regarding updates](#regarding-updates).

# Contributing
Contributions are very much welcome. Here are some quick guidelines:

- For bugs or new features that **already have an issue**: assign this issue to yourself.
- For bugs or new features that **do not have an existing issue**: open an issue or discussion regarding it.
- Try to **avoid adding new dependencies** where feasible.
- Ideally, code should be clean and performant. However, if you have to choose between the two, **favour performance**.
- If refactoring, **make sure to open an issue** regarding it and explain the **reasoning behind your changes**.

# Regarding updates
In my country of residence, all male citizens are required to serve in the military for a period of around 2 years. As of writing, I am still on active duty, which means that I will often be away from my computer for long stretches of time. Thus, I seek your understanding if updates are slow.
